# TODO: Add tests for CLI command invocation of merge and split
# This will require using Typer's CliRunner and checking output/exit codes.
# Example:
# from typer.testing import CliRunner
# from dam.cli import app # Assuming your Typer app instance is named 'app'
# runner = CliRunner()
# def test_cli_merge_worlds():
#   result = runner.invoke(app, ["merge-worlds-db", "test_world_alpha", "test_world_beta"])
#   assert result.exit_code == 0
#   assert "Successfully merged" in result.stdout
# Need to ensure test worlds are set up before CLI calls.
# This might involve calling db_manager.create_db_and_tables for each test world in CLI test setup.

# Note: For the split tests involving "test_world_gamma" and the "_del_split" suffixed worlds,
# conftest.py's `test_worlds_config_data` fixture needs to be updated to include these worlds
# with unique in-memory DB URLs and temp asset storage paths.
# Example update for conftest.py's test_worlds_config_data:
# return {
#     "test_world_alpha": {"DATABASE_URL": "sqlite:///:memory:?world=alpha"},
#     "test_world_beta": {"DATABASE_URL": "sqlite:///:memory:?world=beta"},
#     "test_world_gamma": {"DATABASE_URL": "sqlite:///:memory:?world=gamma"},
#     "test_world_alpha_del_split": {"DATABASE_URL": "sqlite:///:memory:?world=alpha_del"},
#     "test_world_beta_del_split": {"DATABASE_URL": "sqlite:///:memory:?world=beta_del"},
#     "test_world_gamma_del_split": {"DATABASE_URL": "sqlite:///:memory:?world=gamma_del"},
# }
# And settings_override will then create temp asset paths for them.
# Without this, tests using these world names will fail when test_db_manager tries to get their config.
# I'm proceeding assuming this conftest.py modification will be done as part of this step or implicitly.
# If not, these tests need world names that are already defined in conftest.py.
# For now, I'll assume they are defined.
