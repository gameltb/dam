# DAM Package Network Research Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a network research plan to investigate future optimization directions and feature enhancements for the `dam` package. The goal is to gather information on best practices, emerging technologies, and competitor strategies to inform the future development of the DAM system. This research will provide a clear roadmap for improving asset storage, search capabilities, and asset management methodologies.

## 2. Competitor Analysis

- **Identify Key Competitors:** Research and list the leading open-source and commercial Digital Asset Management (DAM) systems.
- **Feature Comparison:** Analyze the core features of each competitor, including their approaches to asset storage, metadata management, and search.
- **Strengths and Weaknesses:** Identify the strengths and weaknesses of each competitor's offering.
- **Target Audience and Pricing:** Investigate the target audience and pricing models of commercial DAM solutions.

## 3. Technology and Library Integration

### 3.1. Asset Storage
- **Cloud Storage Solutions:** Evaluate the pros and cons of using cloud storage providers like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.
- **On-Premise and Hybrid Solutions:** Research on-premise and hybrid storage solutions for organizations with specific security or data sovereignty requirements.
- **Distributed File Systems:** Investigate the use of distributed file systems like IPFS for decentralized and resilient asset storage.

### 3.2. Search and Discovery
- **Full-Text Search:** Research advanced full-text search engines like Elasticsearch and OpenSearch.
- **Vector Search:** Investigate the use of vector databases and similarity search for finding visually or semantically similar assets.
- **Faceted Search:** Explore how to implement faceted search to allow users to filter assets by various criteria.

### 3.3. Knowledge Graphs
- **Graph Databases:** Research graph databases like Neo4j and Amazon Neptune for modeling complex relationships between assets.
- **Ontologies and Taxonomies:** Investigate how to use ontologies and taxonomies to create a structured knowledge base of assets.

### 3.4. AI/ML Integration
- **Auto-Tagging and Classification:** Research AI/ML models and libraries for automatically tagging and classifying assets based on their content.
- **Object Detection and Recognition:** Investigate the use of object detection and recognition to identify objects and faces in images and videos.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Explore how NLP can be used to extract information from text-based assets and improve search.

## 4. Asset Organization and Management Methodologies

- **Metadata Standards:** Research industry-standard metadata schemas like Dublin Core, IPTC, and XMP.
- **Taxonomy and Folksonomy:** Investigate the use of controlled vocabularies (taxonomy) and user-generated tags (folksonomy) for organizing assets.
- **Asset Lifecycles:** Research best practices for managing the entire lifecycle of an asset, from ingestion to archiving and deletion.
- **Versioning:** Explore different strategies for versioning assets and tracking their history.

## 5. Performance and Scalability Improvements

- **Asset Ingestion Pipelines:** Research techniques for optimizing the performance of asset ingestion and processing pipelines.
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Investigate the use of CDNs to improve the performance of asset delivery to users.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Explore the feasibility of adopting a microservices architecture to improve the scalability and maintainability of the system.

## 6. Security Enhancements

- **Access Control:** Research different access control models (e.g., role-based access control, attribute-based access control) for securing assets.
- **Digital Rights Management (DRM):** Investigate DRM technologies for protecting copyrighted assets from unauthorized use and distribution.
- **Data Encryption:** Research best practices for encrypting assets at rest and in transit.

## 7. User Feedback and Feature Requests

- **Surveys and Questionnaires:** Outline a plan for creating and distributing surveys and questionnaires to gather user feedback.
- **User Interviews:** Plan and conduct user interviews to gain a deeper understanding of user needs and pain points.
- **Feature Request Tracking:** Establish a system for tracking and prioritizing feature requests from users.
