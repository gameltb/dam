# Domarkx Design Specification

This document outlines the design and architecture of the `domarkx` system.

## Core Concepts

`Domarkx` is designed to make Markdown documentation executable. It achieves this by parsing Markdown files, identifying code blocks, and executing them in a controlled environment. The key components of the system are:

-   **Document Parser**: Responsible for reading and parsing Markdown files.
-   **Code Block Executor**: Executes code blocks using various execution engines (e.g., local shell, remote Jupyter kernel).
-   **Agent**: An LLM-powered agent that can interact with the user and execute commands.
-   **CLI**: A command-line interface for interacting with the `domarkx` system.

## Architecture

The system is designed to be modular and extensible. The core components are loosely coupled and can be replaced or extended as needed.

-   **Actions**: The `action` module contains the core logic for executing documents and code blocks.
-   **Models**: The `models` module contains data models for representing documents, code blocks, and other entities.
-   **Tools**: The `tools` module contains a collection of tools that can be used by the agent.

## Future Development

-   **Support for more languages and execution engines.**
-   **Improved agent capabilities.**
-   **A more robust and user-friendly UI.**
